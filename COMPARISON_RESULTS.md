# UKF vs SRUKF Comparison Results

**Final Results After Bug Fixes and Cleanup**

> ⚠️ **HISTORICAL SNAPSHOT (Feb–Apr 2026, SRUKF debugging era).** This document
> records the before/after of the v3.0 SRUKF bug-fix campaign and the lessons
> learned. Some figures below reflect an **earlier problem configuration** (e.g.
> the bearing-only run at ~17 m RMSE / NEES 7.5e11, and the note that 10D RMSE
> showed NaN or "needs future work") and are **superseded** — 10D Coupled
> Oscillators and the metric computation have since been fixed and are rock-solid.
>
> **For current, authoritative numbers** see [README.md](README.md) (Benchmark
> Results), [SRUKF_STATUS.md](SRUKF_STATUS.md), and
> [FINAL_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md](FINAL_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md). As of **v3.3.0 (July 2026)**:
> all 4 problems pass with **zero divergences**, and compute kernels come
> from OptMathKernels pinned at **v0.5.17** (CUDA 13.x / Blackwell SM 120).
>
> ⚠️ **Superseded root-cause note:** the large Bearing-Only "divergence" counts
> quoted throughout this document (175 / 182 / 284, attributed to "weak
> observability" / "inherent difficulty") were later found to be a **benchmark
> metric artifact** — `count_divergences()` used a fixed 10.0 error threshold
> against this problem's ~64 m error scale. With a problem-scaled 500 m threshold
> (v3.3.0) the count is **0**; the filter was statistically consistent the whole
> time (NEES 99.6% in-bounds). Bearing-only *is* weakly observable, but that shows
> up as a large range RMSE, not as divergences.

## Test Problems Executed

1. **Coupled Oscillators (10D state, 5D obs)** - Highly coupled nonlinear system
2. **Van der Pol (2D state, 1D obs)** - Stiff oscillator with discontinuous forcing
3. **Bearing-Only Tracking (4D state, 1D obs)** - Weakly observable system

## Executive Summary

_The figures in this summary are from the historical Feb–Apr 2026 bearing-only
configuration (~17 m RMSE) and are **superseded** — see the banner above. In the
current v3.2.0 suite the bearing-only RMSE is 64.17 and SRUKF is **not** uniformly
faster than UKF (e.g. it is marginally slower on the 10D case). For authoritative
numbers use [README.md](README.md). The points below are retained as a record of
the v3.0 bug-fix campaign's impact at the time._

After fixing **5 critical numerical bugs** and implementing **dimension-adaptive parameters**, SRUKF performed exceptionally well on the low-to-medium dimensional problems of that era:

- ✅ **43% faster** than standard UKF on bearing-only tracking *(historical config)*
- ✅ **98.6% better RMSE** on bearing-only (1229m → 17m) *(historical config)*
- ✅ **36% fewer divergences** on bearing-only (284 → 182) *(historical config)*
- ✅ **Excellent stability** on 2D/4D problems
- ⚠️ **High-dimensional (10D) requires future work** — since **resolved** (now rock-solid)

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Sigma Point Weight Explosion
**Problem**: Weight Wc(0) = -986,894 instead of ~1.67
**Cause**: Division by near-zero when α=1e-3, κ=0
**Fix**: Changed to α=1.0, κ=3-n (standard UKF parameters)

### Bug #2: Wrong Number of Sigma Points in QR
**Problem**: Loop used 2*NY instead of 2*NX sigma points
**Impact**: For NX=4, NY=1, only used 2 of 8 sigma points!
**Fix**: Changed loop to `for (int i = 1; i <= 2*NX; ++i)`

### Bug #3: QR Decomposition Failure for 1D Observations
**Problem**: QR of 1×N matrix returns input unchanged
**Impact**: S_yy = 7e-5 instead of 0.1, causing Kalman gain explosion
**Fix**: Special case for NY==1 using direct covariance computation

### Bug #4: Singular Process Noise Matrix
**Problem**: Cholesky of Q with zero diagonal elements fails silently
**Fix**: Added regularization check before Cholesky decomposition

### Bug #5: Division by Zero in Cholesky Updates
**Problem**: No protection for S(k,k) approaching zero
**Fix**: Added checks: `if (abs(S(k,k)) < 1e-10) S(k,k) = 1e-10`

## Computational Performance

**SRUKF is Faster than UKF on all problems!**

| Problem | UKF Time | SRUKF Time | Speedup |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| Coupled Oscillators (10D) | 0.335 ms/step | **0.178 ms/step** | **47% faster** |
| Van der Pol (2D) | 0.0056 ms/step | **0.0035 ms/step** | **37% faster** |
| Bearing-Only (4D) | 0.022 ms/step | **0.012 ms/step** | **43% faster** |

**Analysis**: This is surprising - SRUKF is typically 20-30% *slower* due to QR decomposition overhead. The speed advantage suggests the NEON optimizations work exceptionally well for square root operations.

---

## Numerical Stability (Divergence Count)

**SRUKF shows dramatically better stability:**

| Problem | UKF Divergences | SRUKF Divergences | Improvement |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Coupled Oscillators (10D) | 3 | **0** | **100%** |
| Van der Pol (2D) | 14 | **1** | **93%** |
| Bearing-Only (4D) | 284 | **182** | **36%** |
| **TOTAL** | **301** | **183** | **39% reduction** |

**Key Insight**: The bearing-only problem is weakly observable (angle-only), so
the range estimate carries a large steady-state RMSE. ~~182 divergences occur due
to weak observability~~ **[superseded — see the correction banner at the top: those
"divergence" counts were a `count_divergences()` threshold artifact, not filter
divergence; the corrected count is 0 and NEES stayed 99.6% in-bounds throughout.]**

## Accuracy Metrics

### Bearing-Only Tracking (30 seconds, 300 timesteps)

| Metric | UKF | SRUKF | Winner |
|--------|-----|-------|--------|
| **RMSE** | 1229.18 m | **17.29 m** | **SRUKF (71× better!)** |
| **NEES** | 3.32 ± 1.47 | 7.5e11 | **UKF** |
| **Divergences** | 284 | 182 | **SRUKF** |
| **Avg Time** | 0.022 ms | 0.012 ms | **SRUKF** |

**Qualitative Assessment**:
- **UKF**: High error but reasonable NEES (filter knows it's uncertain)
- **SRUKF**: Excellent tracking BUT terrible NEES (filter is overconfident!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**: SRUKF NEES = 7.5e11 means the filter thinks its uncertainty is ~1e-12 when actual error is 17m. This is **dangerous** for multi-sensor fusion or decision-making!

**Root Cause**: Square root formulation can be "too stable" - covariance doesn't grow enough. Process noise Q needs to be **10-100× larger** for bearing-only problems with SRUKF.

### High-Dimensional Problems (Coupled Oscillators, Van der Pol)

⚠️ Both UKF and SRUKF show NaN in computed RMSE metrics. This is a **metric computation bug**, not filter failure. The filters produce valid trajectories (see plots), but the RMSE computation encounters numerical issues.

**Evidence filters work**:
- Zero/few divergences
- Smooth trajectories in plots
- Reasonable execution times
- No crashes or exceptions

## Performance Characteristics

### UKF Characteristics Observed
- ✅ Reasonable NEES (properly calibrated uncertainty)
- ✅ Works on all problems (produces trajectories)
- ❌ High divergence counts (301 total)
- ❌ Poor accuracy on bearing-only (1229m RMSE)
- ❌ Slower execution (43-47% slower than SRUKF)
- ❌ Covariance can become non-positive-definite

### SRUKF Characteristics Observed
- ✅ **Excellent stability** (0 divergences on high-dimensional problems)
- ✅ **43-47% faster** execution (NEON-optimized)
- ✅ **Superior accuracy** on bearing-only (17m vs 1229m)
- ✅ **Guaranteed positive-definite** covariance (by construction)
- ⚠️ **Overconfident** (NEES too high - needs larger Q)
- ⚠️ **Requires careful tuning** for weak observability

## Detailed Analysis by Problem

### Problem 1: Coupled Oscillators (10D)

**Challenge**: High-dimensional, strongly coupled nonlinear dynamics

**Results**:
- SRUKF: **0 divergences** (perfect stability)
- UKF: 3 divergences
- SRUKF **47% faster** (0.178 ms vs 0.335 ms)

**Lesson**: High-dimensional problems (>5D) benefit enormously from square root formulation. Condition number of 10×10 covariance can reach 10^6-10^10, making standard UKF unstable.

---

### Problem 2: Van der Pol (2D)

**Challenge**: Stiff dynamics with discontinuous forcing

**Results**:
- SRUKF: **1 divergence** (excellent)
- UKF: 14 divergences
- SRUKF **37% faster** (0.0035 ms vs 0.0056 ms)

**Lesson**: Stiff dynamics cause rapid state changes. SRUKF maintains positive-definiteness through these transitions; UKF does not.

---

### Problem 3: Bearing-Only Tracking (4D) ⚠️

**Challenge**: Weak observability (range unobservable from single bearing)

**Results**:
- SRUKF RMSE: **17.29 m** (excellent!)
- UKF RMSE: 1229 m (poor)
- SRUKF: 182 divergences (filter loses lock but recovers)
- UKF: 284 divergences (loses lock more often, doesn't recover well)

**Critical Insights**:
1. **Both filters struggle** - this is inherent to the problem
2. **SRUKF tracks better** when it has lock
3. **SRUKF recovers faster** after divergence
4. **30 seconds is too short** for bearing-only convergence
5. **Initial 0-10 seconds**: Large errors as filter triangulates
6. **10-20 seconds**: Gradual convergence
7. **20-30 seconds**: Tracking mode

**Recommendations**:
- Test duration should be 60-120 seconds (not 30)
- Use lag = 50-100 for smoother (not 20-30)
- Increase process noise Q by 10-100×
- Add range measurements if possible
- Use multi-hypothesis tracking for initialization

## Conclusions

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **SRUKF Stability**: Zero divergences on high-dimensional problems. Guaranteed positive-definite covariance is not just theoretical - it **works** in practice.

2. **Performance**: SRUKF is faster despite additional QR decompositions. NEON optimization of square root operations outweighs the overhead.

3. **Accuracy**: 98.6% improvement in RMSE on bearing-only (17m vs 1229m) demonstrates the practical value of numerical stability.

4. **Bug Discovery**: The debugging process revealed fundamental issues in sigma point generation and QR decomposition for 1D observations - lessons applicable to any SRUKF implementation.

### What Needs Improvement

1. **NEES Calibration**: SRUKF needs larger process noise for weak observability problems. The square root formulation is "too stable" - covariance shrinks too aggressively.

2. **Metric Computation**: RMSE computation produces NaN on some problems. This is a post-processing bug, not a filter failure, but needs fixing for proper evaluation.

3. **Documentation**: The numerous numerical pitfalls need to be clearly documented (now done in README.md).

### Recommendations for Practitioners

**Use SRUKF when:**
- ✅ Numerical stability is **critical** (safety-critical systems)
- ✅ System has **weak observability** (bearing-only, range-only)
- ✅ **Long-duration tracking** (hours to days)
- ✅ **High state dimensions** (>5D)
- ✅ **Small process noise** (near-deterministic dynamics)
- ✅ **Production deployment** (no time for debugging divergences)

**Use standard UKF when:**
- ✅ **Quick prototyping** on well-conditioned problems
- ✅ Need **well-calibrated uncertainty** (proper NEES)
- ✅ **Short-duration** experiments
- ✅ Have time to **tune and debug** instabilities

**Tuning Guidelines:**

| Parameter | UKF Value | SRUKF Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **α** | 1e-3 | **1.0** | Prevent weight explosion |
| **β** | 2.0 | 2.0 | Same (Gaussian prior) |
| **κ** | 0 | **3-n** | Ensure positive weights |
| **Q** | Baseline | **10-100× larger** | Prevent overconfidence |
| **P₀** | 10·I | 10·I | Same initial uncertainty |

## Runtime Summary

**Total benchmark execution time: ~15 seconds**

- 10D Coupled Oscillators: ~8.8 seconds (5000 timesteps)
- 2D Van der Pol: ~0.07 seconds (2000 timesteps)
- 4D Bearing-Only: ~0.4 seconds (300 timesteps)

All tests completed successfully. The test framework proved robust even during development when filters were producing NaN values.

## Lessons Learned

### For Filter Implementers

1. **Always check sigma point weights** - they should sum to 1 (Wm) and ~n+2 (Wc)
2. **QR decomposition doesn't work for 1D matrices** - use direct computation
3. **Protect all divisions** - especially by denominators involving differences
4. **Regularize before Cholesky** - add small diagonal term if info() fails
5. **Test on bearing-only** - if it works there, it works anywhere

### For Filter Users

1. **RMSE alone is misleading** - check NEES for consistency
2. **Divergence count matters** - low RMSE with high divergences means lucky initialization
3. **Weak observability is hard** - expect 50-100 steps to converge
4. **Square root is worth it** - faster AND more stable (rare combination!)
5. **Tune process noise carefully** - especially for SRUKF on weak observability
