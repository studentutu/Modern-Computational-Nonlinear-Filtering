This repository provides nonlinear filtering implementations optimized for **ARM aarch64** (Raspberry Pi 5, Orange Pi 5/6) and **x86_64** using **ARM NEON/SVE2 intrinsics**, **Vulkan compute shaders**, and **NVIDIA CUDA**. All implementations use single-precision floating point (`float`) for maximum SIMD vectorization efficiency.

### What's Included

- **5 Filtering Methods**: EKF, UKF, SRUKF, PKF, RBPKF
- **Fixed-Lag Smoothers**: Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) backward pass and ancestry-based smoothing
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: 4 challenging test problems with full metrics (10D coupled oscillators, Van der Pol, bearing-only tracking, reentry vehicle)
- **Hardware Acceleration**: NEON dense linear algebra + Vulkan particle operations + CUDA GPU acceleration via [OptimizedKernels](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA) (OptMathKernels), pinned to release tag **[v0.5.17](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA/releases/tag/v0.5.17)**

### Platform Support

| Platform | Acceleration | Status |

## Benchmark Results

Four challenging problems tested with UKF, SRUKF, and fixed-lag smoothers. Benchmarks run through the FilterMath dispatch layer (CUDA cuBLAS / SVE2 / NEON / Eigen, selected at runtime by platform).

> **Latest run**: 8 July 2026 on **Ubuntu 26.04 LTS x86_64**, **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU (Blackwell, SM 120)** with **CUDA 13.1**, Eigen 3.4, Vulkan 1.4, against **OptMathKernels v0.5.17** (pinned release tag). All **25/25** CTest cases pass (9 filter tests + 16 OptimizedKernels GPU/SIMD tests, including the CUDA kernel suite on the Blackwell GPU and the Vulkan suites, which now auto-select the discrete RTX 5070 Ti).

> **Host note**: the **RMSE / NEES / divergence** figures are backend-independent
> and reproduce on any platform (the FilterMath dispatch selects CUDA / SVE2 /
> NEON / Eigen but computes the same result). The **25/25** count and the wall-clock
> **timings** are specific to that x86_64 + CUDA reference host: a CPU-only or ARM
> host runs the Eigen/NEON path (no CUDA suite; the count and per-step times differ)
> and still reproduces the accuracy numbers. Build and CTest are exercised on ARM
> (aarch64) as well as the x86_64 reference host.

Reproduce everything below with:

```bash
# from the build directory (see Build Instructions)
./Benchmarks/run_benchmarks                              # writes benchmark_results.csv + trajectory CSVs
source ../.nlfvenv/bin/activate                          # Python venv created by the build
python3 ../scripts/plot_benchmarks.py .                  # writes the PNGs shown here
```

### Coupled Oscillators (10D State, 5D Observation)

![Coupled Oscillators trajectories](docs/images/coupled_osc_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Ten coupled states tracked over 50 s; True, Filtered, and Smoothed curves are nearly indistinguishable across all dimensions. Smoothing improves RMSE by **21%** (1.457 → 1.148). NEES 94.5% in chi-squared bounds indicates excellent consistency. This is the case that previously failed with NaN before the v3.1.0 audit (resolved via dimension-adaptive sigma-point parameters and a safe Cholesky downdate) — now rock-solid with zero divergences.

### Van der Pol Oscillator (2D State, 1D Observation)

![Van der Pol trajectories](docs/images/vanderpol_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Classic relaxation oscillator: slow drift in `x0` with sharp limit-cycle transitions in `x1` (the spikes near t≈1.5 s and t≈11 s). The filter captures the fast transitions without lag; the smoother visibly tightens the estimate in noisy stretches. Smoothing improves RMSE by **8%** (0.466 → 0.430). SRUKF is ~2× faster than UKF on this small problem.

### Bearing-Only Tracking (4D State, 1D Observation)

![Bearing-only trajectories](docs/images/bearing_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Weak-observability problem: angle-only measurements barely constrain range, so the range estimate drifts (large steady-state RMSE ~64) even though the filter stays statistically consistent — NEES holds at **99.6% in-bounds** throughout. Smoothing improves RMSE by **19%** (64.17 → 52.03) but cannot fully recover the lost range. (Earlier runs reported a spurious ~175 "divergence" count here; that was a benchmark-metric bug — a fixed 10 m error threshold measured against this problem's ~64 m error scale — corrected in v3.3.0 with a problem-scaled 500 m threshold, so the divergence count is now **0**. The filter never actually diverged; NEES was in-bounds the whole time.)

### Reentry Vehicle (6D State, 3D Observation)

![Reentry vehicle trajectories](docs/images/reentry_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Realistic spacecraft reentry with altitude-dependent gravity (μ/r²), exponential-atmosphere drag, and a ground-based radar. Position states (`x0`–`x2`) track the truth almost exactly; the noisy velocity states (`x3`, `x5`) show the smoother clearly reducing noise relative to the filter. NEES median 4.99 (expected ~6) with 95.6% in bounds. Smoothing improves RMSE by **36%** (369.2 → 236.8) — the largest gain of the four problems.

> **Note on the trajectory plots**: the Smoothed (red) curve is correctly aligned to the time it estimates and ends one fixed-lag window before the filtered curve (the smoother has no refined estimate for the most recent `lag` steps). Earlier revisions showed a spurious run of leading zeros here; that was a CSV-writer alignment bug (the RMSE numbers were always correct) and is fixed as of the latest commit.

### Filter & Smoother Test Results

| Test | Filter RMSE | Smoother RMSE | Improvement |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| EKF (Nonlinear Oscillator, 2D) | 0.060 | 0.052 | 13% |
| UKF (Drag Ball, 4D) | 0.228 | 0.119 | 48% |
| SRUKF (Drag Ball, 4D) | 0.354 | 0.165 | 53% |
| PKF (Lorenz-63, 3D) | 0.802 | 0.600 | 25% |

### v3.0.0 Before/After Comparison

Comparison between v2.8.0 (commit `12b8015`, direct NEON calls, `-ffast-math`) and v3.0.0 (commit `2d87c48`, FilterMath SVE2/NEON dispatch, bug fixes). Same hardware, same seeds, same trajectories.

#### Efficiency — Total Benchmark Time (ms)

| Filter + Problem | v2.8.0 | v3.0.0 | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| UKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 135.1 | **109.9** | **-18.7%** |
| SRUKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 89.3 | 90.6 | +1.4% |
| UKF+Smoother — Coupled Osc 10D | 574.9 | 739.1 | +28.6%† |
| SRUKF+Smoother — Coupled Osc 10D | 821.7 | 974.7 | +18.6%† |
| SRUKF — Van der Pol 2D | 0.94 | 1.17 | +0.23ms‡ |
| SRUKF — Bearing-Only 4D | 0.30 | 0.36 | +0.06ms‡ |
| SRUKF — Reentry 6D | 1.22 | 1.30 | +0.08ms‡ |

> † Smoother slowdown from replacing `neon_inverse()` with numerically stable `solve_spd()` (SPD triangular solve). Correctness over speed.
>
> ‡ Sub-millisecond absolute differences; dominated by measurement noise.
>
> **Key win**: UKF 10D **18.7% faster** — SVE2 cache-blocked GEMM (tuned for A720 12MB L3) paying off on the largest matrix operations.

#### Accuracy — RMSE (identical seeds)

| Filter + Problem | v2.8.0 | v3.0.0 |
|---|---:|---:|
| UKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 1.4566 | 1.4567 |
| SRUKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 1.4566 | 1.4567 |
| UKF — Van der Pol 2D | 0.4681 | 0.4681 |
| SRUKF — Bearing-Only 4D | 43.151 | 43.151 |
| SRUKF — Reentry 6D | 369.21 | 369.18 |

This is a **historical v2.8.0 → v3.0.0 regression snapshot**: it shows that the
v3.0 dispatch-layer refactor preserved accuracy to floating-point precision for
the problem configurations *as they were then*. The Bearing-Only scenario has
since changed, so its figure here (43.151) does not match the current **64.17**
in the main results table above — that main table is the authoritative current
result; this row is retained only as a historical refactor-regression check and
is not directly comparable to the current Bearing-Only run. NEES consistency
unchanged (all pass chi-squared bounds).

#### Robustness — Bug Fixes

| Bug Fixed | Before (silent failure mode) | After |
|---|---|---|
| Global `-ffast-math` | `isfinite()` guards compiled out — NaN propagates undetected | NaN guards work correctly |
| Unsafe `cholupdate_downdate` | Covariance silently corrupted when downdate magnitude too large | Safe version + full-covariance fallback |
| SRUKF S_yy NaN check | Only diagonal checked — off-diagonal NaN/Inf missed | `allFinite()` on entire matrix |
| RBPKF weight NaN | One NaN particle corrupts all weights | `isfinite()` guard + uniform fallback |
| RBPKF ESS div-by-zero | Returns Inf, breaks resampling threshold | Returns N (forces resampling) |
| RBPKF resampling bias | O(N) float rounding — last particles underselected | Kahan compensated summation |
| Cross-platform build | Direct `optmath::neon::*` — fails on x86 | `#if FILTERMATH_ARM64` + Eigen fallback |

## Numerical Stability Guide

This section documents real numerical issues encountered during development.

### Issue #1: Sigma Point Weight Explosion

**Problem**: With alpha=1e-3, the central sigma point weight becomes extremely negative.

**Root Cause**: When alpha^2*(n+kappa) is approximately equal to n, the denominator n+lambda approaches zero.

**Solution**: Use alpha=1.0 and kappa=3-n, with protection against degenerate spread:
```cpp
float n_lambda = n + lambda;
if (n_lambda < 0.5f) {
    kappa = n / (alpha * alpha) - n;
    lambda = alpha * alpha * (n + kappa) - n;
    n_lambda = n + lambda;
}
```

### Issue #2: Cholesky Downdate Instability

**Problem**: Cholesky downdate can produce negative diagonal elements when the update magnitude exceeds the current factor.

**Solution**: Safe downdate with detection and fallback:
```cpp
float r_sq = S(k,k)*S(k,k) - v_scaled(k)*v_scaled(k);
if (r_sq <= 0) {
    // Downdate failed — recompute P directly and take fresh Cholesky
    return false;
}
```

### Issue #3: Innovation Gating for SRUKF

**Problem**: Large outlier measurements cause catastrophic state updates.

**Solution**: Mahalanobis distance gating scales down corrections:
```cpp
float mahal_dist_sq = temp_innov.squaredNorm();
if (mahal_dist_sq > gate_threshold) {
    scale = std::sqrt(gate_threshold / mahal_dist_sq);
}
State correction = scale * (K * innovation);
```

### Issue #4: Eigen Expression Template Aliasing in SRUKF Mean Computation

**Problem**: The SRUKF predict step's weighted-mean loop returned the INPUT state instead of the PROPAGATED state, so `predict()` appeared to leave the state unchanged.

**Root Cause**: Eigen's expression templates caused aliasing between `X_pred` (propagated sigma points) and `sigmas.X` (input sigma points) during weighted mean computation. The operation `x_pred_mean += Wm(i) * X_pred.col(i)` was reading from `sigmas.X` memory instead of `X_pred`, even though they were separate stack-allocated matrices.

**Symptoms**:
- State appears unchanged after `predict()`
- Debug shows `X_pred` values are correct, but the weighted mean equals the input
- Double-precision accumulation gives the correct result while the float loop gives the wrong one

**Solution**: Force evaluation with `.eval()` to materialize the expression and break aliasing, combined with `.noalias()` for safe accumulation. This preserves NEON/SVE2 auto-vectorization (unlike the earlier raw C array workaround). The fix lives in `UKF/include/SRUKF.h` (see the `X_pred_eval` / `Wm_eval` block):
```cpp
// Force evaluation to break Eigen aliasing while keeping SIMD vectorization
typename SigmaPts::SigmaMat X_pred_eval = X_pred.eval();
typename SigmaPts::Weights Wm_eval = sigmas.Wm.eval();

State x_pred_mean = State::Zero();
for (int i = 0; i < SigmaPts::NSIG; ++i) {
    x_pred_mean.noalias() += Wm_eval(i) * X_pred_eval.col(i);
}
```

**Result**: `predict()` now propagates the state correctly; the coupled-oscillator and reentry benchmarks pass with zero divergences.

### Issue #5: Global `-ffast-math` Breaks Filter Stability

**Problem**: CMake root had `-ffast-math` and `EIGEN_FAST_MATH=1` applied globally to all Release builds. This silently caused:
- NaN comparison guards (`isfinite()`, `allFinite()`) to be optimized away
- Cholesky decomposition precision loss from altered floating-point associativity
- Denormal flushing that corrupted small covariance values

**Solution**: Removed global `-ffast-math` and `EIGEN_FAST_MATH=1` from root `CMakeLists.txt`. The NEON/SVE2 intrinsics in OptMathKernels already provide hardware-accelerated fast paths where needed. Numerically sensitive targets should explicitly set `-fno-fast-math` and `EIGEN_FAST_MATH=0`.

### Issue #6: Unsafe Cholesky Downdate in SRUKF Prediction

**Problem**: The SRUKF predict step used the legacy `cholupdate_downdate()` which silently corrupted the square root covariance when the downdate magnitude exceeded the current factor (sets `r_sq = 1e-6 * S(k,k)²` instead of failing).

**Solution**: Replaced with `cholupdate_downdate_safe()` which returns false on failure, plus a full-covariance fallback that recomputes P from all sigma points and takes a fresh Cholesky.

### Issue #7: RBPKF Weight Corruption and Resampling Bias

**Problem**: Three related issues in the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter:
1. `normalize_weights()` did not check `isfinite()` — a single NaN weight corrupted all particles
2. `get_effective_sample_size()` could divide by zero when all weights collapsed
3. Cumulative sum in resampling used naive float addition, accumulating O(N) rounding error that systematically underselected the last particles

**Solution**:
1. Added `isfinite()` guard with uniform-weight fallback for degenerate cases
2. Added `sum_sq <= 0` guard returning `N` (forces resampling)
3. Replaced naive cumulative sum with Kahan compensated summation in both systematic and stratified resampling

### Numerical Health Checklist

Before deploying any Kalman filter, verify:

- Sigma point weights sum to 1 for Wm
- Central weight Wc(0) is reasonable (not exploding)
- Covariance diagonal elements are positive
- Innovation covariance >= measurement noise R
- Kalman gain is bounded
- State estimates don't diverge

## Features

### Hardware Optimization

- **FilterMath Dispatch Layer** (`Common/include/FilterMath.h`): Unified API that automatically selects the best backend at runtime:
  - **GEMM**: CUDA cuBLAS → SVE2 cache-blocked → NEON blocked → Eigen
  - **Cholesky / Inverse / Solve**: NEON accelerated → Eigen LDLT fallback
  - **Kalman Gain**: SPD solve (avoids explicit matrix inverse for O(n²) vs O(n³))
  - **Non-ARM platforms**: Falls through to Eigen (or CUDA if available)
- **FilterMathGPU** (`Common/include/FilterMathGPU.h`): GPU-specific acceleration:
  - **GPUBufferPool**: Reusable device allocations to minimize PCIe overhead
  - **GPUSigmaContext\<NX\>**: GPU-accelerated sigma point operations for UKF/SRUKF
- **Particle Filter GPU** (`PKF/include/particle_filter_gpu.hpp`): CUDA particle filter:
  - **GPUParticleContext\<NX\>**: Manages particles/weights on GPU
  - GPU log-sum-exp weight normalization
  - GPU systematic/stratified resampling
  - Auto-enable for N >= 256 particles
- **ARM NEON Dense Linear Algebra**: Cholesky, GEMM, mat-vec multiply, SPD solve via [OptimizedKernels](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA)
- **ARM SVE2**: Cache-blocked GEMM with FCMA and I8MM on Cortex-A720+ (Orange Pi 5/6)
- **Vulkan Compute**: Particle filter noise addition parallelized on GPU (Mali-G720, VideoCore VII, discrete GPUs). As of OptMathKernels v0.5.14, device selection prefers a **discrete GPU with a compute queue** over integrated/CPU fallbacks — on multi-GPU hosts the discrete card (e.g. RTX 5070 Ti) is chosen and logged at init.
- **Graceful Fallback**: CUDA → SVE2 → NEON → Eigen with jitter + retry for numerical robustness
- **Single Precision**: Consistent use of `float` for SIMD vectorization

> **CUDA Status**: Active for SM 75–90 (CUDA 12.x) and SM 75–120 incl. Blackwell RTX 50-series (CUDA 13.x). Verified on RTX 5070 Ti / SM 120 with CUDA 13.1 (see [DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md](DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md))

### Software Quality

- **C++20**: Modern features (concepts, ranges, template constraints)
- **Type Safety**: Template metaprogramming for compile-time dimension checking
- **Joseph Form**: Numerically stable covariance update throughout
- **OpenMP**: Parallel particle propagation and weight updates

---

## Dependencies

### Required

- **C++20 Compiler**: GCC 10+, Clang 11+
- **Eigen3**: Linear algebra (3.4+, fetched automatically if not found)
- **CMake**: Build system (3.14+)
- **Python 3**: (3.10+) For visualization scripts; a virtual environment is created automatically during the build
- **[OptimizedKernels](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA)** (OptMathKernels): NEON/SVE2/Vulkan/CUDA acceleration, fetched automatically via FetchContent from the public GitHub URL (override with `-DOPTMATH_REPO=<local-path>` for offline builds). **Pinned to a release tag** for reproducible builds — see `OPTMATH_RELEASE_TAG` in the root `CMakeLists.txt` (currently **v0.5.17**). Bumping it is a deliberate, audited step; see [DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md](DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md) → *OptMathKernels Release Audit & Pinning Policy*.

### Optional

- **ARM NEON/SVE2**: Automatic on ARM aarch64 platforms
- **Vulkan SDK + glslang-tools**: For GPU-accelerated particle filter (Vulkan 1.3+); `glslang-tools` provides `glslangValidator` to compile GLSL shaders to SPIR-V
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**: For GPU-accelerated GEMM and particle filter (12.x supports SM 75–90; 13.x adds Blackwell, incl. RTX 50-series SM 120). Ensure `nvcc` is on `PATH` (e.g. `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH`) so CMake detects it.
- **OpenMP**: For parallel particle filter

### Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libeigen3-dev
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv

# Vulkan shader compiler (required for Vulkan GPU tests)
sudo apt install glslang-tools

# Optional: Vulkan runtime (if not already installed)
sudo apt install vulkan-tools libvulkan-dev

# (Optional) Pre-clone the OptimizedKernels dependency for OFFLINE builds.
# By default the build fetches it automatically from the public GitHub URL via
# FetchContent (no manual step needed). Only pre-clone if you want to build
# offline or against a local working copy, then point the build at it with
# -DOPTMATH_REPO=$HOME/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA (see Build Options).
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA.git
```

#### Optional: NVIDIA CUDA (GPU acceleration)

CUDA is auto-detected at configure time, but **only if `nvcc` is on your `PATH`** — installing the toolkit alone is not enough. Install the toolkit (12.x for Turing–Hopper, **13.x for Blackwell / RTX 50-series**), then expose it:

```bash
# Install the toolkit (example: CUDA 13.1 on Ubuntu, or use the .run/.deb from
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
sudo apt install cuda-toolkit-13-1

# Put nvcc + runtime libs on PATH. Append to ~/.bashrc to persist across shells:
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Verify CMake will find it
nvcc --version          # should print the toolkit version
nvidia-smi              # should list your GPU + driver
```

> CUDA 13.x ships `nvcc` that accepts host GCC up to 15. The build forwards `-march=native` to the CUDA host compiler via `-Xcompiler`, so the C++ and CUDA translation units stay ABI-consistent (mismatched Eigen alignment between them otherwise corrupts the heap).

### Build Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=""` | Disable CUDA (e.g., if toolkit is not installed or causes issues) |
| `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native` | Build CUDA code for the detected GPU only. Optional on CUDA 13.x (default list already includes Blackwell SM 100/120); useful to shrink build time |
| `-DOPTMATH_CUDA_NATIVE=ON` | Make the OptimizedKernels dependency honor `native` instead of its default multi-arch list |
| `-DOPTMATH_REPO=<url-or-path>` | OptMathKernels source (default: public GitHub URL). Set to a local clone path for offline builds |
| `-DNLF_BUILD_PYTHON_VENV=OFF` | Skip creating the plotting Python venv (the C++ build then needs no Python/PyPI — for offline/CI) |
| `-DOPTMATH_RELEASE_TAG=v0.5.17` | OptMathKernels release tag to fetch/pin (default `v0.5.17`). Bump only after auditing the upstream diff — see [DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md](DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md) |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` | Optimized build with `-O3 -march=native` (forwarded to nvcc's host compiler via `-Xcompiler` for ABI consistency) |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | Debug build with symbols |

### Build Outputs

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EKF/ekf_test` | EKF with fixed-lag smoother on nonlinear oscillator |
| `UKF/ukf_test` | UKF with fixed-lag smoother on drag ball model |
| `UKF/srukf_test` | SRUKF with fixed-lag smoother on drag ball model |
| `PKF/pkf_test` | Particle filter unit tests |
| `PKF/pkf_example` | Particle filter on Lorenz-63 attractor |
| `RBPKF/test_rbpf_basic` | RBPF unit tests |
| `RBPKF/example_rbpf_ctrv` | RBPF on CTRV vehicle model |
| `Benchmarks/run_benchmarks` | Full benchmark suite (4 problems, 4 filters) |

## Usage Examples

### Basic SRUKF Usage

```cpp
#include "SRUKF.h"
#include "MyModel.h"  // Your state-space model

int main() {
    // Define model (must inherit from StateSpaceModel<NX, NY>)
    MyModel<4, 2> model;  // 4 states, 2 observations

    // Create SRUKF filter
    UKFCore::SRUKF<4, 2> filter(model);

    // Initialize
    Eigen::Vector4f x0;
    x0 << 0, 0, 10, 15;
    Eigen::Matrix4f P0 = Eigen::Matrix4f::Identity();
    filter.initialize(x0, P0);

    // Process measurements
    Eigen::Vector4f u = Eigen::Vector4f::Zero();
    for (int k = 0; k < num_steps; ++k) {
        filter.predict(time[k], u);
        filter.update(time[k], measurements[k]);

        auto x_est = filter.getState();
        auto P_est = filter.getCovariance();  // Reconstructs P = S*S^T
    }
}
```

### SRUKF with Fixed-Lag Smoother

```cpp
#include "SRUKFFixedLagSmoother.h"
#include "MyModel.h"

int main() {
    MyModel<4, 2> model;
    int lag = 50;

    UKFCore::SRUKFFixedLagSmoother<4, 2> smoother(model, lag);
    smoother.initialize(x0, P0);

    Eigen::Vector4f u = Eigen::Vector4f::Zero();
    for (int k = 0; k < num_steps; ++k) {
        smoother.step(time[k], measurements[k], u);

        auto x_filt = smoother.get_filtered_state();
        auto x_smooth = smoother.get_smoothed_state(lag);  // Lag steps back
    }
}
```

### Custom Model Implementation

```cpp
#include "StateSpaceModel.h"

template<int NX = 4, int NY = 1>
class BearingOnlyTracking : public UKFModel::StateSpaceModel<NX, NY> {
public:
    using State = Eigen::Matrix<float, NX, 1>;
    using Observation = Eigen::Matrix<float, NY, 1>;
    using StateMat = Eigen::Matrix<float, NX, NX>;
    using ObsMat = Eigen::Matrix<float, NY, NY>;

    float dt = 0.1f;

    // Process model: constant velocity
    State f(const State& x, float t,
            const Eigen::Ref<const State>& u) const override {
        State x_next;
        x_next(0) = x(0) + dt * x(2);  // px += vx * dt
        x_next(1) = x(1) + dt * x(3);  // py += vy * dt
        x_next(2) = x(2);
        x_next(3) = x(3);
        return x_next;
    }

    // Observation model: bearing angle
    Observation h(const State& x, float t) const override {
        Observation y;
        y(0) = std::atan2(x(1), x(0));
        return y;
    }

    StateMat Q(float t) const override {
        StateMat q = StateMat::Zero();
        q(2, 2) = 0.1f;
        q(3, 3) = 0.1f;
        return q;
    }

    ObsMat R(float t) const override {
        ObsMat r;
        r(0, 0) = 0.01f;
        return r;
    }
};
```
