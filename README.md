## Overview

This repository provides nonlinear filtering implementations in **portable C++20 + Eigen**, with **optional** SIMD and GPU acceleration (ARM NEON/SVE2 intrinsics, Vulkan compute shaders, NVIDIA CUDA). The filters themselves are architecture-neutral: `Common/include/FilterMath.h` resolves the available backend tiers at compile time and falls back to plain Eigen, so the library builds and produces equivalent results on **any** C++20 target — with no accelerator backend at all. All implementations use single-precision floating point (`float`), which suits SIMD vectorization where it is available.

### What's Included

- **5 Filtering Methods**: EKF, UKF, SRUKF, PKF, RBPKF
- **Smoothers**: fixed-lag RTS, full-interval (batch) RTS with optional iteration (an IEKS for the EKF), and ancestry-based particle smoothing
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: 4 test problems in the default suite with full metrics (10D coupled oscillators, Van der Pol, bearing-only tracking, reentry vehicle)
- **Optional Acceleration**: NEON/SVE2 dense linear algebra, Vulkan compute, and CUDA via [OptimizedKernels](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA) (OptMathKernels), consumed as a sibling source tree built with `add_subdirectory` (currently **v0.6.3**; no pinned release tag)

---

## Portability

The filters are portable C++; only the backends are architecture-specific, and every
backend is optional. The build detects the **target** architecture
(`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`, cross-compile aware) and reports it at configure time:

```
-- Target architecture: ARM64
-- SIMD backends: NEON=ON SVE2=ON (SVE2 sources are skipped unless the CPU implements it)
-- Native CPU tuning: -mcpu=native
```

ARM-only backends are never forced onto a non-ARM target; on any other architecture
the same configure step reports `SIMD backends: none for <arch> - filter math uses the
Eigen fallback path` and the build proceeds normally.

### Acceleration Tiers (all optional)

| Backend | Where it applies | Default | Notes |
|---------|------------------|---------|-------|
| **Eigen** (baseline) | every C++20 target | always | The fallback. Correct and complete on its own — no other tier is required. |
| **NEON** | ARM (`aarch64`/`armv8`, `arm`) | ON for ARM targets | Cholesky, GEMM, mat-vec, SPD solve. `-DNLF_ENABLE_NEON=OFF` to disable. |
| **SVE2** | ARM CPUs that implement SVE2 (Cortex-A720+, e.g. Orange Pi 5/6) | ON for ARM targets | Cache-blocked GEMM with FCMA/I8MM. Sources are skipped on ARM CPUs without SVE2 (such as the Pi 5's Cortex-A76), so leaving it ON on a non-SVE2 ARM board is harmless. |
| **Vulkan** | any target with a Vulkan 1.2+ SDK/driver | ON, auto-skipped with no SDK | Compute backend in OptMathKernels. See the note under [Features](#hardware-optimization) about which operations actually reach the GPU. |
| **CUDA** | NVIDIA GPUs, SM 75–120 | auto-detected via `nvcc` | cuBLAS GEMM + GPU particle filter. CUDA 12.x = SM 75–90; 13.x adds Blackwell (SM 100/120). |

### Verified: the library does not need a SIMD backend

A build configured with **every** SIMD tier off and portable codegen —
`-DNLF_ENABLE_NEON=OFF -DNLF_ENABLE_SVE2=OFF -DNLF_ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=OFF`, i.e. what a
brand-new architecture gets on day one — compiles, runs, and passes **30/30** CTest
cases, exactly as the NEON build does. Comparing benchmark RMSE between the two builds:

| Benchmark problem | Eigen-only vs. NEON |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Coupled Oscillators 10D | bit-identical |
| Van der Pol 2D | bit-identical |
| Bearing-Only 4D | 0.0008% difference |
| Reentry 6D | 0.02% difference |

The two non-zero deltas are pure floating-point association (Eigen's summation order
vs. NEON's), not a behavioural difference. Accuracy is a property of the filters, not
of the backend; **only wall-clock timings change.**

> **Note on CUDA architectures**: CUDA 12.x covers Turing through Hopper (SM 75–90). CUDA 13.x adds Blackwell — including consumer RTX 50-series (**SM 120**, e.g. RTX 5070/5080/5090). To build for your exact GPU, configure with `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native -DOPTMATH_CUDA_NATIVE=ON`. See [DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md](DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md) for details.

## Implemented Filters

### 1. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

**Jacobian-based linearization**

- **Method**: First-order Taylor series approximation
- **Requirements**: Explicit Jacobian matrices
- **Smoothing**: RTS fixed-lag backward pass (`EKF/include/EKFFixedLag.h`) + full-interval iterated RTS / IEKS (`EKF/include/EKFSmoother.h`)
- **Best For**: Mildly nonlinear systems, fast prototyping
- **Location**: `EKF/`

### 2. Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)

**Derivative-free sigma point method**

- **Method**: Deterministic sampling via Merwe scaled unscented transform
- **Parameters**: Dimension-adaptive (alpha=1.0, beta=2.0, kappa=3-n)
- **Smoothing**: RTS with cross-covariance tracking — fixed-lag (`UKF/include/UnscentedFixedLagSmoother.h`) + full-interval iterated (`UKF/include/UKFSmoother.h`)
- **Best For**: Highly nonlinear systems where Jacobians are unavailable or expensive
- **Location**: `UKF/`
- **Optimization**: GEMM, Cholesky and SPD solve go through the FilterMath dispatch — SVE2/NEON where present, Eigen otherwise

### 3. Square Root UKF (SRUKF)

**Numerically stable square root formulation**

- **Method**: Propagates Cholesky factor S where P = S*S^T
- **Algorithm**: QR decomposition + rank-1 Cholesky updates/downdates with safe fallbacks
- **Advantages**:
  - Guaranteed positive-definite covariance
  - Innovation gating prevents catastrophic updates
  - Safe Cholesky downdate with automatic fallback to full recomputation
- **Best For**: Mission-critical, long-duration, weak observability systems
- **Location**: `UKF/include/SRUKF.h`; smoothers in `UKF/include/SRUKFFixedLagSmoother.h` (fixed-lag) and `UKF/include/SRUKFSmoother.h` (full-interval, iterated)

### 4. Particle Filter (PKF)

**Bootstrap sequential importance resampling**

- **Method**: Monte Carlo approximation with particle ensemble
- **Resampling**: Systematic, stratified
- **Smoothing**: Ancestry-based fixed-lag trajectory reconstruction
- **Best For**: Non-Gaussian noise, multimodal distributions
- **Location**: `PKF/`
- **Optimization**: OpenMP parallel propagation; CUDA particle context auto-enabled at N >= 256 when built with CUDA. A Vulkan noise-addition path exists but rarely engages — see the [Vulkan note](#hardware-optimization) under Features.

### 5. Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPKF)

**Hybrid particle-Kalman filter**

- **Method**: Marginalize linear substructure analytically via conditional Kalman filters
- **Structure**: Nonlinear particles + linear Kalman filters per particle
- **Advantages**: Reduced variance vs standard particle filter
- **Best For**: Systems with conditionally linear subspace (e.g., CTRV models)
- **Location**: `RBPKF/`

## Benchmark Results

Four problems tested with UKF, SRUKF, and fixed-lag smoothers. Benchmarks run through the FilterMath dispatch layer, which selects whatever backend the build provides (CUDA cuBLAS / SVE2 / NEON / Eigen) and computes the same result either way.

> **How to read these numbers.** **RMSE, NEES and divergence counts are
> backend- and host-independent** — they reproduce on any machine, with or without a
> SIMD/GPU backend (see [Portability](#portability): an Eigen-only build is
> bit-identical on two of the four problems and within 0.02% on the others).
> **Wall-clock timings are host-specific and do not transfer.** Every timing below is
> therefore attributed to the machine that produced it. No single machine is "the"
> reference; the suite is run on several.

**Hosts used below:**

| Host | Configuration | Used for |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **A** — x86_64 | Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU (Blackwell, SM 120), CUDA 13.1, Eigen 3.4, Vulkan 1.4 | timings in the summary table (run 8 July 2026) |
| **B** — ARM aarch64 | Raspberry Pi 5 (Cortex-A76, 4 cores), NEON + Vulkan (V3D), no CUDA, no SVE2 | accuracy re-verification, portability comparison (run 14 July 2026) |

Accuracy figures below were produced on host A and re-verified unchanged on host B.
CTest is **30/30** on both (12 filter/benchmark tests registered by this repo + 18
OptimizedKernels GPU/SIMD tests). The exact dependency suite varies with the build:
host A additionally exercises the CUDA kernel tests and selects the discrete GPU for
the Vulkan suites; host B runs the same Vulkan suites on the VideoCore V3D and skips
CUDA.

Reproduce everything below with:

```bash
# from the build directory (see Build Instructions)
./Benchmarks/run_benchmarks                              # writes benchmark_results.csv + trajectory CSVs
source ../.nlfvenv/bin/activate                          # Python venv created by the build
python3 ../scripts/plot_benchmarks.py .                  # writes the PNGs shown here
```

`benchmark_results.csv` columns (one header row):

```
Filter,Problem,RMSE_Overall,RMSE_Smoothed_Overall,Median_NEES,Pct_In_Bounds,NEES_Valid,NEES_Total,Avg_Step_Time_ms,Total_Time_ms,Convergence_Time,Num_Divergences
```

`Convergence_Time` is left **empty** when the filter never met the convergence
threshold — missing data reads as missing, in pandas and in a spreadsheet.

### Summary Across All Problems

**Estimation accuracy** — filtered vs. smoothed RMSE and filter consistency (median NEES):

![RMSE / NEES comparison](docs/images/benchmark_rmse_comparison.png)

**Computational cost** — per-step and total wall-clock time (**host A**; re-run the suite to get your own):

![Timing comparison](docs/images/benchmark_timing_comparison.png)

**Convergence & stability** — time-to-converge and divergence counts:

![Convergence comparison](docs/images/benchmark_convergence_comparison.png)

> **Caveat on the convergence panel**: `compute_convergence_time()`
> (`Benchmarks/include/BenchmarkRunner.h`) uses a fixed **0.5-unit absolute** error
> threshold, which is not meaningful for problems whose error scale is far larger —
> Bearing-Only (~64) and Reentry (~369) legitimately never reach it. Those rows now
> report an **empty** `Convergence_Time` cell and print "did not converge" rather
> than silently emitting the final timestamp as if it were a measurement. Read that
> panel for the Coupled-Oscillator and Van der Pol rows only.

Consolidated metrics (`benchmark_results.csv`). RMSE / NEES / Div are
host-independent; **Avg step** and **Total** are from **host A**:

| Problem | Filter | RMSE | Smoothed RMSE | NEES median | In 95% | Avg step (host A)† | Total (host A)† | Div |
|---------|--------|-----:|--------------:|------------:|-------:|---------:|------:|----:|
| Coupled Osc 10D | UKF | 1.457 | — | 9.89 | 94.5% | 0.0076 ms | 38.2 ms | 0 |

| Bearing-Only 4D | SRUKF | 63.84 | — | 3.72 | 99.6% | 0.00046 ms | 0.15 ms | 0 |
| Bearing-Only 4D | SRUKF+Smoother | 63.84 | **51.68** | 3.72 | 99.6% | 0.0108 ms | 3.25 ms | 0 |

### Coupled Oscillators (10D State, 5D Observation)

![Coupled Oscillators trajectories](docs/images/coupled_osc_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Ten coupled states tracked over 50 s; True, Filtered, and Smoothed curves are nearly indistinguishable across all dimensions. Smoothing improves RMSE by **21%** (1.457 → 1.148). NEES 94.5% in chi-squared bounds indicates excellent consistency. This is the case that previously failed with NaN before the v3.1.0 audit (resolved via dimension-adaptive sigma-point parameters and a safe Cholesky downdate) — now rock-solid with zero divergences.

### Van der Pol Oscillator (2D State, 1D Observation)

![Van der Pol trajectories](docs/images/vanderpol_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Classic relaxation oscillator: slow drift in `x0` with sharp limit-cycle transitions in `x1` (the spikes near t≈1.5 s and t≈11 s). The filter captures the fast transitions without lag; the smoother visibly tightens the estimate in noisy stretches. Smoothing improves RMSE by **8%** (0.467 → 0.430). SRUKF is ~1.4× faster than UKF on this small problem (consistent on both hosts).

### Bearing-Only Tracking (4D State, 1D Observation)

![Bearing-only trajectories](docs/images/bearing_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Weak-observability problem: angle-only measurements barely constrain range, so the range estimate drifts (large steady-state RMSE ~64) even though the filter stays statistically consistent — NEES holds at **99.6% in-bounds** throughout. Smoothing improves RMSE by **19%** (63.84 → 51.68) but cannot fully recover the lost range. (Earlier runs reported a spurious ~175 "divergence" count here; that was a benchmark-metric bug — a fixed 10 m error threshold measured against this problem's ~64 m error scale — corrected in v3.3.0 with a problem-scaled 500 m threshold, so the divergence count is now **0**. The filter never actually diverged; NEES was in-bounds the whole time.)

### Reentry Vehicle (6D State, 3D Observation)

![Reentry vehicle trajectories](docs/images/reentry_srukf_smooth_plot.png)

Realistic spacecraft reentry with altitude-dependent gravity (μ/r²), exponential-atmosphere drag, and a ground-based radar. Position states (`x0`–`x2`) track the truth almost exactly; the noisy velocity states (`x3`, `x5`) show the smoother clearly reducing noise relative to the filter. NEES median 4.99 (expected ~6) with 95.9% in bounds. Smoothing improves RMSE by **36%** (367.1 → 236.3) — the largest gain of the four problems.

> **Note on the trajectory plots**: the Smoothed (red) curve is correctly aligned to the time it estimates and ends one fixed-lag window before the filtered curve (the smoother has no refined estimate for the most recent `lag` steps). Earlier revisions showed a spurious run of leading zeros here; that was a CSV-writer alignment bug (the RMSE numbers were always correct) and is fixed as of the latest commit.

### Filter & Smoother Test Results

Each row is the filtered-vs-smoothed pair reported by that test's own smoother run
(`ekf_test`, `ukf_test`, `srukf_test`, `pkf_example`), re-measured after the
timestep-alignment fix:

| Test | Filter RMSE | Smoother RMSE | Improvement |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| EKF (Nonlinear Oscillator, 2D) | 0.060 | 0.052 | 13% |
| UKF (Drag Ball, 4D) | 0.228 | 0.119 | 48% |
| SRUKF (Drag Ball, 4D) | 0.311 | 0.167 | 46% |
| PKF (Lorenz-63, 3D) | 0.813 | 0.604 | 26% |

> The PKF row is a Monte-Carlo result on a chaotic system, so it moves slightly
> from host to host (floating-point association changes which particles survive
> resampling); the other three are deterministic and reproduce exactly.

### v3.0.0 Before/After Comparison

Comparison between v2.8.0 (commit `12b8015`, direct NEON calls, `-ffast-math`) and v3.0.0 (commit `2d87c48`, FilterMath SVE2/NEON dispatch, bug fixes). Same hardware, same seeds, same trajectories.

#### Efficiency — Total Benchmark Time (ms)

| Filter + Problem | v2.8.0 | v3.0.0 | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| UKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 135.1 | **109.9** | **-18.7%** |
| SRUKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 89.3 | 90.6 | +1.4% |
| UKF+Smoother — Coupled Osc 10D | 574.9 | 739.1 | +28.6%† |
| SRUKF+Smoother — Coupled Osc 10D | 821.7 | 974.7 | +18.6%† |
| SRUKF — Van der Pol 2D | 0.94 | 1.17 | +0.23ms‡ |
| SRUKF — Bearing-Only 4D | 0.30 | 0.36 | +0.06ms‡ |
| SRUKF — Reentry 6D | 1.22 | 1.30 | +0.08ms‡ |

> † Smoother slowdown from replacing `neon_inverse()` with numerically stable `solve_spd()` (SPD triangular solve). Correctness over speed.
>
> ‡ Sub-millisecond absolute differences; dominated by measurement noise.
>
> **Key win**: UKF 10D **18.7% faster** — SVE2 cache-blocked GEMM (tuned for A720 12MB L3) paying off on the largest matrix operations.

#### Accuracy — RMSE (identical seeds)

| Filter + Problem | v2.8.0 | v3.0.0 |
|---|---:|---:|
| UKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 1.4566 | 1.4567 |
| SRUKF — Coupled Osc 10D | 1.4566 | 1.4567 |
| UKF — Van der Pol 2D | 0.4681 | 0.4681 |
| SRUKF — Bearing-Only 4D | 43.151 | 43.151 |
| SRUKF — Reentry 6D | 369.21 | 369.18 |

This is a **historical v2.8.0 → v3.0.0 regression snapshot**: it shows that the
v3.0 dispatch-layer refactor preserved accuracy to floating-point precision for
the problem configurations *as they were then*. The Bearing-Only scenario has
since changed, so its figure here (43.151) does not match the current **63.84**
in the main results table above — that main table is the authoritative current
result; this row is retained only as a historical refactor-regression check and
is not directly comparable to the current Bearing-Only run. NEES consistency
unchanged (all pass chi-squared bounds).

#### Robustness — Bug Fixes

| Bug Fixed | Before (silent failure mode) | After |
|---|---|---|
| Global `-ffast-math` | `isfinite()` guards compiled out — NaN propagates undetected | NaN guards work correctly |
| Unsafe `cholupdate_downdate` | Covariance silently corrupted when downdate magnitude too large | Safe version + full-covariance fallback |
| SRUKF S_yy NaN check | Only diagonal checked — off-diagonal NaN/Inf missed | `allFinite()` on entire matrix |
| RBPKF weight NaN | One NaN particle corrupts all weights | `isfinite()` guard + uniform fallback |
| RBPKF ESS div-by-zero | Returns Inf, breaks resampling threshold | Returns N (forces resampling) |
| RBPKF resampling bias | O(N) float rounding — last particles underselected | Kahan compensated summation |
| Cross-platform build | Direct `optmath::neon::*` — fails on x86 | `#if FILTERMATH_ARM64` + Eigen fallback |

## Numerical Stability Guide

This section documents real numerical issues encountered during development.

### Issue #1: Sigma Point Weight Explosion

**Problem**: With alpha=1e-3, the central sigma point weight becomes extremely negative.

**Root Cause**: When alpha^2*(n+kappa) is approximately equal to n, the denominator n+lambda approaches zero.

**Solution**: Use alpha=1.0 and kappa=3-n, with protection against degenerate spread:
```cpp
float n_lambda = n + lambda;
if (n_lambda < 0.5f) {
    kappa = n / (alpha * alpha) - n;
    lambda = alpha * alpha * (n + kappa) - n;
    n_lambda = n + lambda;
}
```

### Issue #2: Cholesky Downdate Instability

**Problem**: Cholesky downdate can produce negative diagonal elements when the update magnitude exceeds the current factor.

**Solution**: Safe downdate with detection and fallback:
```cpp
float r_sq = S(k,k)*S(k,k) - v_scaled(k)*v_scaled(k);
if (r_sq <= 0) {
    // Downdate failed — recompute P directly and take fresh Cholesky
    return false;
}
```

### Issue #3: Innovation Gating for SRUKF

**Problem**: Large outlier measurements cause catastrophic state updates.

**Solution**: Mahalanobis distance gating scales down corrections:
```cpp
float mahal_dist_sq = temp_innov.squaredNorm();
if (mahal_dist_sq > gate_threshold) {
    scale = std::sqrt(gate_threshold / mahal_dist_sq);
}
State correction = scale * (K * innovation);
```

### Issue #4: Eigen Expression Template Aliasing in SRUKF Mean Computation

**Problem**: The SRUKF predict step's weighted-mean loop returned the INPUT state instead of the PROPAGATED state, so `predict()` appeared to leave the state unchanged.

**Root Cause**: Eigen's expression templates caused aliasing between `X_pred` (propagated sigma points) and `sigmas.X` (input sigma points) during weighted mean computation. The operation `x_pred_mean += Wm(i) * X_pred.col(i)` was reading from `sigmas.X` memory instead of `X_pred`, even though they were separate stack-allocated matrices.

**Symptoms**:
- State appears unchanged after `predict()`
- Debug shows `X_pred` values are correct, but the weighted mean equals the input
- Double-precision accumulation gives the correct result while the float loop gives the wrong one

**Solution**: Force evaluation with `.eval()` to materialize the expression and break aliasing, combined with `.noalias()` for safe accumulation. This preserves NEON/SVE2 auto-vectorization (unlike the earlier raw C array workaround). The fix lives in `UKF/include/SRUKF.h` (see the `X_pred_eval` / `Wm_eval` block):
```cpp
// Force evaluation to break Eigen aliasing while keeping SIMD vectorization
typename SigmaPts::SigmaMat X_pred_eval = X_pred.eval();
typename SigmaPts::Weights Wm_eval = sigmas.Wm.eval();

State x_pred_mean = State::Zero();
for (int i = 0; i < SigmaPts::NSIG; ++i) {
    x_pred_mean.noalias() += Wm_eval(i) * X_pred_eval.col(i);
}
```

**Result**: `predict()` now propagates the state correctly; the coupled-oscillator and reentry benchmarks pass with zero divergences.

### Issue #5: Global `-ffast-math` Breaks Filter Stability

**Problem**: CMake root had `-ffast-math` and `EIGEN_FAST_MATH=1` applied globally to all Release builds. This silently caused:
- NaN comparison guards (`isfinite()`, `allFinite()`) to be optimized away
- Cholesky decomposition precision loss from altered floating-point associativity
- Denormal flushing that corrupted small covariance values

**Solution**: Removed global `-ffast-math` and `EIGEN_FAST_MATH=1` from root `CMakeLists.txt`. The NEON/SVE2 intrinsics in OptMathKernels already provide hardware-accelerated fast paths where needed. Numerically sensitive targets should explicitly set `-fno-fast-math` and `EIGEN_FAST_MATH=0`.

### Issue #6: Unsafe Cholesky Downdate in SRUKF Prediction

**Problem**: The SRUKF predict step used the legacy `cholupdate_downdate()` which silently corrupted the square root covariance when the downdate magnitude exceeded the current factor (sets `r_sq = 1e-6 * S(k,k)²` instead of failing).

**Solution**: Replaced with `cholupdate_downdate_safe()` which returns false on failure, plus a full-covariance fallback that recomputes P from all sigma points and takes a fresh Cholesky.

### Issue #7: RBPKF Weight Corruption and Resampling Bias

**Problem**: Three related issues in the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter:
1. `normalize_weights()` did not check `isfinite()` — a single NaN weight corrupted all particles
2. `get_effective_sample_size()` could divide by zero when all weights collapsed
3. Cumulative sum in resampling used naive float addition, accumulating O(N) rounding error that systematically underselected the last particles

**Solution**:
1. Added `isfinite()` guard with uniform-weight fallback for degenerate cases
2. Added `sum_sq <= 0` guard returning `N` (forces resampling)
3. Replaced naive cumulative sum with Kahan compensated summation in both systematic and stratified resampling

### Numerical Health Checklist

Before deploying any Kalman filter, verify:

- Sigma point weights sum to 1 for Wm
- Central weight Wc(0) is reasonable (not exploding)
- Covariance diagonal elements are positive
- Innovation covariance >= measurement noise R
- Kalman gain is bounded
- State estimates don't diverge

## Features

### Hardware Optimization

- **FilterMath Dispatch Layer** (`Common/include/FilterMath.h`): Unified API that selects the best tier the build provides:
  - **GEMM**: CUDA cuBLAS → SVE2 cache-blocked → NEON blocked → Eigen
  - **Cholesky / Inverse / Solve**: NEON accelerated → Eigen LDLT fallback
  - **Kalman Gain**: SPD solve (avoids explicit matrix inverse for O(n²) vs O(n³))
  - **Any platform with no backend**: falls through to Eigen — always available, always correct
- **Particle Filter GPU** (`PKF/include/particle_filter_gpu.hpp`): CUDA particle filter:
  - **GPUParticleContext\<NX\>**: Manages particles/weights on GPU
  - GPU log-sum-exp weight normalization
  - GPU systematic/stratified resampling
  - Auto-enable for N >= 256 particles (CUDA builds only; a no-CUDA build always uses the CPU path)
- **ARM NEON Dense Linear Algebra**: Cholesky, GEMM, mat-vec multiply, SPD solve via [OptimizedKernels](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA)
- **ARM SVE2**: Cache-blocked GEMM with FCMA and I8MM on Cortex-A720+ (e.g. Orange Pi 5/6). Not present on the Cortex-A76 (Raspberry Pi 5), where the SVE2 sources are simply skipped.
- **Vulkan Compute**: Device selection prefers a **discrete GPU with a compute queue** over integrated/CPU fallbacks, and logs the choice at init.
- **Graceful Fallback**: CUDA → SVE2 → NEON → Eigen with jitter + retry for numerical robustness
- **Single Precision**: Consistent use of `float`, which vectorizes well where SIMD is available

> **Vulkan reality check**: the particle filter contains a Vulkan noise-addition path
> (gated at `N > 100` in `PKF/include/particle_filter.hpp`), but OptMathKernels routes
> elementwise operations below **2^20 elements** to the CPU
> (`OPTMATH_VK_ELTWISE_MIN`, `src/vulkan/vulkan_backend.cpp`). The flattened buffer is
> `N*NX` floats, so a 3-state model would need ~350,000 particles before anything
> reaches the GPU. At realistic particle counts this path computes on the CPU. The
> threshold is deliberate: on the tested integrated GPUs, dispatch overhead exceeds the
> work for memory-bound elementwise kernels. Treat Vulkan here as available
> infrastructure, not as an active accelerator for typical particle counts.

> **FilterMathGPU status**: `Common/include/FilterMathGPU.h` (`GPUBufferPool`,
> `GPUSigmaContext<NX>`) is **experimental and not yet wired in** — no filter currently
> includes it, and the UKF/SRUKF paths go through `FilterMath.h`. It ships as a public
> header for downstream experimentation only.

> **CUDA Status**: Active for SM 75–90 (CUDA 12.x) and SM 75–120 incl. Blackwell RTX 50-series (CUDA 13.x). See [DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md](DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md).

### Software Quality

- **C++20**: Modern features (concepts, ranges, template constraints)
- **Type Safety**: Template metaprogramming for compile-time dimension checking
- **Joseph Form**: Numerically stable covariance update throughout
- **OpenMP**: Parallel particle propagation and weight updates

---

## Dependencies

### Required

- **C++20 Compiler**: GCC 10+, Clang 11+ (MSVC builds use `/O2`; no native-tuning flag is applied)
- **Eigen3**: Linear algebra (3.4+, fetched automatically if not found). This is the only hard numerical dependency — everything below Eigen in the dispatch chain is optional.
- **CMake**: Build system (**3.18+**). The root project declares 3.14, but the required OptMathKernels dependency is built via `add_subdirectory` and itself requires 3.18, so 3.18 is the effective floor.
- **Python 3**: (3.10+) For visualization scripts; a virtual environment is created automatically during the build
- **[OptimizedKernels](https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA)** (OptMathKernels, currently **v0.6.3**): hosts the optional NEON/SVE2/Vulkan/CUDA kernels. **Required as a sibling directory** next to this repo and built via `add_subdirectory` directly from its **latest `main`** working tree (no pinned release tag). If it is missing, `./bootstrap.sh` offers to clone it over HTTPS and build for you, or configure with `-DAUTO_CLONE_DEPS=ON`. See [Build Instructions](#build-instructions).

### Optional

- **ARM NEON/SVE2**: Enabled by default on ARM targets only (`NLF_ENABLE_NEON` / `NLF_ENABLE_SVE2`); never forced onto a non-ARM target
- **Vulkan SDK + glslang-tools**: For the Vulkan compute backend (**Vulkan 1.2+** — the backend requests `VK_API_VERSION_1_2`); `glslang-tools` provides `glslangValidator` to compile GLSL shaders to SPIR-V. Auto-skipped when no SDK is found.
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**: For GPU-accelerated GEMM and particle filter (12.x supports SM 75–90; 13.x adds Blackwell, incl. RTX 50-series SM 120). Ensure `nvcc` is on `PATH` (e.g. `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH`) so CMake detects it.
- **OpenMP**: For parallel particle filter

### Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libeigen3-dev
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv

# Vulkan shader compiler (required for Vulkan GPU tests)
sudo apt install glslang-tools

# Optional: Vulkan runtime (if not already installed)
sudo apt install vulkan-tools libvulkan-dev

# The OptimizedKernels dependency is REQUIRED as a sibling directory next to this
# repo. bootstrap.sh (see Build Instructions) will offer to clone it for you; to
# provision it manually, clone it beside this repo so both live under the same parent:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/n4hy/OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA.git
```

#### Optional: NVIDIA CUDA (GPU acceleration)

CUDA is auto-detected at configure time, but **only if `nvcc` is on your `PATH`** — installing the toolkit alone is not enough. Install the toolkit (12.x for Turing–Hopper, **13.x for Blackwell / RTX 50-series**), then expose it:

```bash
# Install the toolkit (example: CUDA 13.1 on Ubuntu, or use the .run/.deb from
# https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
sudo apt install cuda-toolkit-13-1

# Put nvcc + runtime libs on PATH. Append to ~/.bashrc to persist across shells:
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Verify CMake will find it
nvcc --version          # should print the toolkit version
nvidia-smi              # should list your GPU + driver
```

> CUDA 13.x ships `nvcc` that accepts host GCC up to 15. When native tuning is active (`NLF_ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=ON`, the default), the build forwards the same probed arch flag to the CUDA host compiler via `-Xcompiler`, so the C++ and CUDA translation units stay ABI-consistent (on x86, mismatched Eigen alignment between them otherwise corrupts the heap).

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone repository

### Build Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-DNLF_ENABLE_NEON=OFF` | Do not build the ARM NEON kernels (default: ON for ARM targets, OFF everywhere else). Filter math falls back to Eigen |
| `-DNLF_ENABLE_SVE2=OFF` | Do not build the ARM SVE2 kernels (default: ON for ARM targets). SVE2 sources are skipped anyway on ARM CPUs that lack SVE2 |
| `-DNLF_ENABLE_VULKAN=OFF` | Do not build the Vulkan compute backend (default: ON; auto-skipped when no SDK is found) |
| `-DNLF_ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH=OFF` | Do not tune for the building machine's CPU. Default ON, and automatically OFF when cross-compiling. Turn OFF for portable/redistributable binaries. When ON, the build *probes* for `-mcpu=native` (ARM) or `-march=native` (x86) and degrades to portable codegen if neither compiles cleanly; MSVC has no equivalent and uses `/O2` |
| `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path>` | Cross-compile. Target arch is read from `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`; native tuning auto-disables |
| `-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=""` | Disable CUDA (e.g., if toolkit is not installed or causes issues) |
| `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native` | Build CUDA code for the detected GPU only. Optional on CUDA 13.x (default list already includes Blackwell SM 100/120); useful to shrink build time |
| `-DOPTMATH_CUDA_NATIVE=ON` | Make the OptimizedKernels dependency honor `native` instead of its default multi-arch list |
| `-DOPTMATH_DIR=<path>` | Path to the required OptimizedKernels sibling source tree (default `../OptimizedKernelsForRaspberryPi5_NvidiaCUDA`). Built directly from its local working tree (latest `main`) |
| `-DAUTO_CLONE_DEPS=ON` | If `OPTMATH_DIR` is missing, clone it (latest `main`) over HTTPS instead of failing (default `OFF`). `./bootstrap.sh` does this interactively |
| `-DNLF_BUILD_PYTHON_VENV=OFF` | Skip creating the plotting Python venv (the C++ build then needs no Python/PyPI — for offline/CI) |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` | Optimized build: `-O3` (or `/O2` on MSVC) plus native tuning when `NLF_ENABLE_NATIVE_ARCH` is ON, forwarded to nvcc's host compiler via `-Xcompiler` for ABI consistency. Release flags are applied via `$<CONFIG:Release>` generator expressions, so multi-config generators (Ninja Multi-Config, Visual Studio, Xcode) get them too |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | Debug build with symbols |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` | Optimized build with symbols (used by the sanitizer CI lane) |
| `-DNLF_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON` | Attach AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer to C++ TUs when the build type is `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo`. Skips CUDA TUs (nvcc does not reliably forward `-fsanitize=...`). Used by the CI sanitizer lane. |

### Build Outputs

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EKF/ekf_test` | EKF with fixed-lag smoother on nonlinear oscillator |
| `EKF/ekf_smoother_test` | EKF full-interval RTS / IEKS smoother regression |
| `UKF/ukf_test` | UKF with fixed-lag smoother on drag ball model |
| `UKF/ukf_smoother_test` | UKF full-interval RTS smoother regression |
| `UKF/srukf_test` | SRUKF with fixed-lag smoother on drag ball model |
| `UKF/srukf_angular_wrap_test` | SRUKF angular-observation (wrap) regression |
| `UKF/srukf_smoother_test` | SRUKF full-interval RTS smoother regression |
| `PKF/pkf_test` | Particle filter unit tests |
| `PKF/pkf_example` | Particle filter on Lorenz-63 attractor |
| `RBPKF/test_rbpf_basic` | RBPF unit tests |
| `RBPKF/example_rbpf_ctrv` | RBPF on CTRV vehicle model |
| `Benchmarks/run_benchmarks` | Full benchmark suite (4 problems, 4 filters) |
| `UKF/test_ukf_numerical` | Audit-remediation regression: Joseph-form P update + LLT/LDLT recovery ladder |
| `UKF/test_srukf_initialize` | Audit-remediation regression: `SRUKF::initialize()` throws on NaN/Inf/asymmetric/non-PSD P0 |
| `PKF/test_particle_const` | Audit-remediation regression: `get_mean` / `get_covariance` are non-const (GPU state may mutate) |
| `RBPKF/test_rbpf_logdet` | Audit-remediation regression: log-det via LDLT-only path is numerically stable at cond ~1e12 |

## Usage Examples

### Basic SRUKF Usage

```cpp
#include "SRUKF.h"
#include "MyModel.h"  // Your state-space model

int main() {
    // Define model (must inherit from StateSpaceModel<NX, NY>)
    MyModel<4, 2> model;  // 4 states, 2 observations

    // Create SRUKF filter
    UKFCore::SRUKF<4, 2> filter(model);

    // Initialize
    Eigen::Vector4f x0;
    x0 << 0, 0, 10, 15;
    Eigen::Matrix4f P0 = Eigen::Matrix4f::Identity();
    filter.initialize(x0, P0);

    // Process measurements.
    //
    // Timestep alignment matters: initialize() leaves the estimate AT time[0], and
    // predict(t) evaluates the process model at t = where the state currently IS.
    // So iteration 0 must not propagate, and advancing time[k-1] -> time[k] passes
    // time[k-1] to predict() and time[k] to update().
    Eigen::Vector4f u = Eigen::Vector4f::Zero();

    filter.update(time[0], measurements[0]);   // fuse y0 where the estimate already is

    for (int k = 1; k < num_steps; ++k) {
        filter.predict(time[k - 1], u);        // propagate FROM time[k-1]
        filter.update(time[k], measurements[k]);  // fuse a measurement taken AT time[k]

        auto x_est = filter.getState();
        auto P_est = filter.getCovariance();  // Reconstructs P = S*S^T
    }
}
```

### SRUKF with Fixed-Lag Smoother

```cpp
#include "SRUKFFixedLagSmoother.h"
#include "MyModel.h"

int main() {
    MyModel<4, 2> model;
    int lag = 50;

    UKFCore::SRUKFFixedLagSmoother<4, 2> smoother(model, lag);
    smoother.initialize(x0, P0);            // estimate now sits AT time[0]

    Eigen::Vector4f u = Eigen::Vector4f::Zero();

    // If you have a measurement at time[0], fuse it where the estimate already is.
    // Calling step() here instead would predict first, landing the estimate at
    // time[1] and folding an observation of x(time[0]) into it. Skip this if your
    // first measurement is at time[1].
    smoother.observe_initial(time[0], measurements[0]);

    for (int k = 1; k < num_steps; ++k) {
        // Two DISTINCT times: propagate from where the estimate is (time[k-1]),
        // then fuse a measurement taken at time[k].
        smoother.step(time[k - 1], time[k], measurements[k], u);

        auto x_filt = smoother.get_filtered_state();
        auto x_smooth = smoother.get_smoothed_state(lag);  // Lag steps back
    }
}
```

### Custom Model Implementation

```cpp
#include "StateSpaceModel.h"

template<int NX = 4, int NY = 1>
class BearingOnlyTracking : public UKFModel::StateSpaceModel<NX, NY> {
public:
    using State = Eigen::Matrix<float, NX, 1>;
    using Observation = Eigen::Matrix<float, NY, 1>;
    using StateMat = Eigen::Matrix<float, NX, NX>;
    using ObsMat = Eigen::Matrix<float, NY, NY>;

    float dt = 0.1f;

    // Process model: constant velocity
    State f(const State& x, float t,
            const Eigen::Ref<const State>& u) const override {
        State x_next;
        x_next(0) = x(0) + dt * x(2);  // px += vx * dt
        x_next(1) = x(1) + dt * x(3);  // py += vy * dt
        x_next(2) = x(2);
        x_next(3) = x(3);
        return x_next;
    }

    // Observation model: bearing angle
    Observation h(const State& x, float t) const override {
        Observation y;
        y(0) = std::atan2(x(1), x(0));
        return y;
    }

    StateMat Q(float t) const override {
        StateMat q = StateMat::Zero();
        q(2, 2) = 0.1f;
        q(3, 3) = 0.1f;
        return q;
    }

    ObsMat R(float t) const override {
        ObsMat r;
        r(0, 0) = 0.01f;
        return r;
    }
};
```
